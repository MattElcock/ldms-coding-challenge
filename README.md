# Frontend-focused Challenge

## Running the application

Boot up the API

`➜ cd api`
`➜ npm install`
`➜ npm start`

Then, the frontend

`➜ cd client`
`➜ npm install`
`➜ npm start`

## Tests

Unfortunately, I'm unfamiliar with how to mock the Fetch API. I had a look, involving some libraries like `jest-fetch-mock`, but I ran into some issues that I wasn't sure how to resolve. So, I haven't tested interactions between the front and backend.

You can run the tests I have written by using the following command:

`➜ cd client`
`➜ npm install` (If you haven't already)
`➜ npm test`
